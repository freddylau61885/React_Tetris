## Scope
Create styled stage for the game\
Create styled dashboard for the game\
Create all Tetrominos for player to maneuver in the game\
Develop algorithms to handle remove role or gameover\
## Team and Role
Freddy Lau developer
## Challenges
1. The App.js file will be long and hard to read if all components included in the file\
2. Difficult to find component style within one CSS file\
3. Methods to create all Tetrominos\
4. Algorithms to handle remove role or gameover\
## Solutions
1. Created a component file on each component and import as needed\
2. Created a style file for each component and use "styled-components" to use CSS to style the component\
3. Created an object (Dictionary) to store shape and color of every Tetrominos. Each data in shape array represent each cell in the game stage\
4. Created hook to store algorithms. (TBC)
